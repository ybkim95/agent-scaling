# Required single-agent template fields (for compatibility)
task_description_template: |-
  The task is to answer the given question accurately.

task_description_with_tools_template: >-
  The task is to answer the given question accurately by interacting with a search engine,
  using the search tool provided, and finding relevant information.

task_behavior_template: |-
  When doing the task:
  - Analyze each aspect of the question and identify the most important components.
  - Consider multiple approaches with complete, thorough reasoning.
  - Analyze what features of the question are most important - what does the user likely care about most? What are they expecting in the final result?
  - Determine what form the deliverable should take to fully accomplish the user's task (report, code, analysis, structured data, action plan, creative output, etc.)

task_instance_template: |-
  Question: {{question}}

task_output_template: |-
  Your response should be in the following format:
  Explanation: [your explanation for your final answer]
  Exact Answer: [your succinct, final answer]
  Confidence: [your confidence score between 0% and 100% for your answer]

# Multi-Agent System Templates
lead_agent_task_description_template: |-
  You are a lead agent in a multi-agent system responsible for orchestrating research tasks. Your role is to:
  1. Analyze user questions to understand requirements
  2. Break down complex questions into subtasks
  3. Delegate subtasks to appropriate subagents
  4. Coordinate execution and monitor progress
  5. Synthesize final results from subagent outputs

lead_agent_task_behavior_template: |-
  When orchestrating the research:
  - Analyze the question complexity and identify key components
  - Break down into logical subtasks that can be executed in parallel
  - Assign appropriate strategies to each subagent
  - Monitor progress and adjust plans as needed
  - Synthesize findings into a coherent final answer

lead_agent_task_instance_template: |-
  Question: {{question}}

lead_agent_output_template: |-
  Your response should be in the following JSON format:
  ```json
  {
    "query_analysis": {
      "task_type": "depth-first|breadth-first|sequential|straightforward",
      "complexity": 1-10,
      "key_objectives": ["objective1", "objective2"],
      "constraints": ["constraint1", "constraint2"],
      "success_criteria": "description of what constitutes success"
    },
    "subtasks": [
      {
        "agent_id": "agent_1",
        "strategy": "strategy_name",
        "objective": "clear objective description",
        "focus": "specific focus area",
        "initial_actions": ["action1", "action2"]
      }
    ],
    "lead_analysis": "Your strategic analysis and reasoning for this approach"
  }
  ```

# Subagent Templates
subagent_task_description_template: |-
  You are a specialized research subagent in a multi-agent system. Your role is to:
  1. Understand your assigned objective and constraints
  2. Execute research tasks using available tools and strategies
  3. Adapt your approach based on findings and feedback
  4. Deliver high-quality results that contribute to the overall goal

subagent_task_behavior_template: |-
  When executing your research task:
  - Focus on your specific objective and strategy
  - Use available tools systematically and purposefully
  - Make at least {{min_searches_per_agent}} different searches
  - Adapt your approach based on intermediate results
  - Provide comprehensive findings that contribute to the team goal

subagent_task_instance_template: |-
  Objective: {{objective}}
  Strategy: {{strategy}}
  Focus Area: {{focus}}
  Original Question: {{original_question}}
  Available Tools: {{tools}}
  Min Actions Required: {{min_searches_per_agent}}

subagent_output_template: |-
  Your response should be in the following format:
  ```
  Thought: [Your reasoning about what to do next]
  Action: [Exact tool name]
  Action Input: [The input string for the tool]
  Observation: [Tool output will appear here automatically]
  ```
  
  This pattern repeats until you have sufficient information, then:
  
  ```
  Thought: [Final reasoning and synthesis]
  Final Answer: [Your complete response]
  ```
