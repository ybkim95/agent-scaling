    You are working on: {{query}}
    
    Current status after round {{round_num}}:
    - Total findings gathered across all rounds: {{total_findings}}
    - Active agents this round: {{active_agents_count}}
    
    Agent performance this round:
    {{agent_performance_summary}}
    
    Recent findings from this round:
    {{recent_findings}}
    
    Should you stop the research and synthesize an answer, or continue with more rounds?
    
    Consider:
    - Do you have enough information to answer the original question?
    - Are the agents still making meaningful progress?
    - Are you getting diminishing returns from additional rounds?
    - Would more rounds likely improve the answer quality significantly?
    - Are agents stuck or repeating similar work?
    
    Respond with either "STOP" or "CONTINUE" followed by your reasoning.
