    You are orchestrating a multi-agent research team. Decide if an individual agent should continue working.
  role: system
- content: |-
    Agent {{agent_id}} status:
    - Objective: {{objective}}
    - Iterations completed: {{iterations_completed}}
    - Current round: {{round_num}}
    - Recent findings: {{findings_count}}
    - Status: {{agent_status}}
    - Recent performance: {{performance_status}}
    
    Should this agent continue working or stop?
    
    Consider:
    - Is the agent making meaningful progress?
    - Are they still discovering useful information?
    - Have they accomplished their objective?
    - Would more iterations be beneficial?
    - Are they stuck or encountering repeated errors?
    
    Respond with "CONTINUE" or "STOP" followed by a brief reason.
