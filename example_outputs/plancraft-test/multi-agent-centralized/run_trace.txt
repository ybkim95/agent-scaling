===================[[system]]===================
You are an intelligent lead agent who can orchestrate multi-agent research tasks.
===================[[user]]===================
You are crafting in Minecraft. The task is to craft the target item using the tools provided.
Crafting Grid: The crafting table is organized into a 3x3 grid. Each slot in the grid has a unique identifier:
  - Top row: [A1] [A2] [A3]
  - Middle row: [B1] [B2] [B3]
  - Bottom row: [C1] [C2] [C3]
The output of the crafting process is placed in a designated output slot labeled [0]. You cannot move or smelt items directly into slot [0].
Inventory Slots: The remaining inventory slots (outside of the crafting grid) are used for storing items. These slots are labeled as [I1] to [I36]
    
Example actions:
  - `move: from [I2] to [A1] with quantity 3`
  - `smelt: from [I5] to [I6] with quantity 1`

Constraints:
- You cannot move or smelt items into [0]
- If an item is not in slot [0] then the recipe is incorrect
- You need to move items from [0] to a free inventory slot to complete the crafting process



For this multi-agent orchestration task, you will coordinate research work across multiple specialized agents.

You have several key responsibilities:
1. PLANNING: Analyze queries and create strategic task decomposition
2. COORDINATION: Provide guidance and feedback to individual agents based on their progress and team context
3. DECISION-MAKING: Determine when the team has sufficient information to proceed to synthesis
4. SYNTHESIS: Combine findings from multiple agents into coherent answers

This is a strategic coordination process where you maintain full visibility across all agents and their findings.

Your decisions should be informed by:
- Individual agent progress and findings
- Overall team progress across all agents
- The relationship between different agents' discoveries
- The sufficiency of collected information for answering the original query

Okay, here's a summary of my findings:

**Action:** I used the `search` tool to find the crafting recipe for diorite_wall.

**Result:** The search revealed that diorite_wall requires diorite to be placed in the top and middle rows of the crafting table (A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3).

**Conclusion:** I do not have diorite in my inventory. Therefore, crafting diorite_wall is currently impossible. I have marked the task as impossible.

You are an intelligent subagent who can use tools, observe the environment, reflect, plan, and reason to solve tasks.
===================[[user]]===================
You are crafting in Minecraft. The task is to craft the target item using the tools provided.
Crafting Grid: The crafting table is organized into a 3x3 grid. Each slot in the grid has a unique identifier:
  - Top row: [A1] [A2] [A3]
  - Middle row: [B1] [B2] [B3]
  - Bottom row: [C1] [C2] [C3]
The output of the crafting process is placed in a designated output slot labeled [0]. You cannot move or smelt items directly into slot [0].
Inventory Slots: The remaining inventory slots (outside of the crafting grid) are used for storing items. These slots are labeled as [I1] to [I36]
    
Example actions:
  - `move: from [I2] to [A1] with quantity 3`
  - `smelt: from [I5] to [I6] with quantity 1`

Constraints:
- You cannot move or smelt items into [0]
- If an item is not in slot [0] then the recipe is incorrect
- You need to move items from [0] to a free inventory slot to complete the crafting process



You are working as part of a multi-agent team. Given communication from the lead agent, use the available tools to work thoroughly and systematically.

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
1. ALWAYS USE TOOLS: You must use tools in every response to make progress
2. AVOID REPETITION: If the same action fails twice, try a different approach

STRATEGY (following expert problem-solving patterns):
1. START BROAD, THEN FOCUS: Begin with general exploration to understand the landscape, then progressively focus on specifics
2. TOOL SELECTION: Examine all available tools first and match tool usage to your specific objective  
3. QUALITY EVALUATION: After each action, evaluate result quality, identify gaps, and refine your approach

This is an iterative process where you will:
1. THINK about your approach and plan your strategy
2. EXECUTE one tool at a time
3. OBSERVE and evaluate the quality of results
4. REFLECT on gaps and needed improvements  
5. PLAN your next iteration with refined approach

We want the best possible results, so your thinking should be thorough and strategic.

Crafting Grid: The crafting table is organized into a 3x3 grid. Each slot in the grid has a unique identifier:
  - Top row: [A1] [A2] [A3]
  - Middle row: [B1] [B2] [B3]
  - Bottom row: [C1] [C2] [C3]
The output of the crafting process is placed in a designated output slot labeled [0]. You cannot move or smelt items directly into slot [0].
Inventory Slots: The remaining inventory slots (outside of the crafting grid) are used for storing items. These slots are labeled as [I1] to [I36]
    
Example actions:
  - `move: from [I2] to [A1] with quantity 3`
  - `smelt: from [I5] to [I6] with quantity 1`

Constraints:
- You cannot move or smelt items into [0]
- If an item is not in slot [0] then the recipe is incorrect
- You need to move items from [0] to a free inventory slot to complete the crafting process



You are working as part of a multi-agent team. Given communication from the lead agent, use the available tools to work thoroughly and systematically.

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
1. ALWAYS USE TOOLS: You must use tools in every response to make progress
2. AVOID REPETITION: If the same action fails twice, try a different approach

STRATEGY (following expert problem-solving patterns):
1. START BROAD, THEN FOCUS: Begin with general exploration to understand the landscape, then progressively focus on specifics
2. TOOL SELECTION: Examine all available tools first and match tool usage to your specific objective  
3. QUALITY EVALUATION: After each action, evaluate result quality, identify gaps, and refine your approach

This is an iterative process where you will:
1. THINK about your approach and plan your strategy
2. EXECUTE one tool at a time
3. OBSERVE and evaluate the quality of results
4. REFLECT on gaps and needed improvements  
5. PLAN your next iteration with refined approach

We want the best possible results, so your thinking should be thorough and strategic.

Here's my plan:

1.  **Search for the diorite recipe:** Use the `search` tool to find the recipe for diorite.
2.  **Craft diorite:** Once I have the recipe, I'll move the required cobblestone and quartz to the crafting grid and check if diorite is created in the output slot \[0].
3.  **Search for the diorite wall recipe:** Use the `search` tool to find the recipe for diorite\_wall.
4.  **Craft diorite wall:** Once I have the recipe, I'll move the required diorite to the crafting grid and check if diorite\_wall is created in the output slot \[0].
5.  **Move the crafted item:** Move the crafted diorite\_wall from the output slot \[0] to an available inventory slot.

Let's start by searching for the diorite recipe.

Okay, I understand the plan. First, I need to craft diorite using cobblestone and quartz. Then, I'll use the diorite to craft the diorite wall.

Here's my plan:

1.  **Search for the diorite recipe:** Use the `search` tool to find the recipe for diorite.
2.  **Craft diorite:** Once I have the recipe, I'll move the required cobblestone and quartz to the crafting grid and check if diorite is created in the output slot \[0].
3.  **Search for the diorite wall recipe:** Use the `search` tool to find the recipe for diorite\_wall.
4.  **Craft diorite wall:** Once I have the recipe, I'll move the required diorite to the crafting grid and check if diorite\_wall is created in the output slot \[0].
5.  **Move the crafted item:** Move the crafted diorite\_wall from the output slot \[0] to an available inventory slot.

Let's start by searching for the diorite recipe.

Okay, here's a summary of my progress so far:

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Searched for diorite recipe:** Used the `search` tool to find the crafting recipe for diorite.
2.  **Moved cobblestone to \[A1]:** Moved 1 cobblestone from \[I32] to \[A1].
3.  **Moved quartz to \[A2]:** Moved 1 quartz from \[I30] to \[A2].

**Results Observed:**

*   The `search` tool successfully returned the diorite recipe: cobblestone at \[A1], quartz at \[A2], quartz at \[B1], and cobblestone at \[B2].
*   The `move` actions were successful, and the items are now in the crafting grid as expected.

**Conclusions:**

*   I have successfully retrieved the diorite recipe and started placing the ingredients in the crafting grid.
*   Next steps: I need to move the remaining quartz and cobblestone to the correct positions in the crafting grid (\[B1] and \[B2]) to craft diorite. Then I need to find the recipe for diorite\_wall.
